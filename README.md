# Found my Dotfiles!

`bin/install` to symlink dotfiles. will not symlink over existing stuff.

`bin/fonts-install` for powerline fonts

`bin/vim-bundle` for vim bundleage

`bin/brew-install` to install brew-cask and basic list of recipes and casks

If you want to change what gets installed, or add other stuff, knock yourself 
out and edit the installer files.

Depends on XCode or command line tools being installed. If you don't have either:

    xcode-select --install

to get the command-line tools, then go ahead.

TODO: Set a bunch of default OSX preferences in a script.
